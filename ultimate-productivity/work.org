  #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Key theme: I often run ls to remember what I'm doing
  #+END_NOTES
*** =ls=
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - show ls operation, ls -l, ls -ldh ~
    - very useful
    - often find myself typing it when I return to a task and need to know where I am/what I'm doing
    - my goto 'what am i doing' tool
  #+END_NOTES
*** =sl=
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - similar arguments to ls
    - Difference is... it shows a train
    - Can't ctrl-c it
    - Have to sit and watch and think about what you did
   #+END_NOTES
** Why did I just type `sl` instead of `ls`
*** You forgot that l isn't s
*** You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
*** You tried to do it too fast
*** You're not paying attention
*** You're trying to do too much at once
** Attention
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
     key theme: - divided attention is no good for coding
   #+END_NOTES
   Cognitive Science is hard. The fundamentals are simple
*** Attention is categorised
*** Attention is limited
*** One model: attention pools, for different domains
     #+BEGIN_NOTES
     Cognitive Science: how we think
     Attention is categorised -- different categories are suited to different purposes
     Attention is limited -- but it's not like a simple gauge that runs out
     behave like resource pools "sharded" by function.
     #+END_NOTES

    Selective attention is deeply focused, when all your resources are used for one thing
    [Divided] attention necessary for multi-tasking* and dealing with more than one thing at once
    We're actually really bad at multi-tasking, and in a study those who rated themselves good at it did worse

    Circumstances often force us to divide our attention, but with effort we can shift it back.
    We can learn techniques to make this easier
    We should know when we have selective attention on the task at hand.
    #+END_NOTES
** Attention as resource.
**** We have attention pools
**** They shard by brain function
**** It's easy to sing and hop
**** It's hard to talk on the phone and write a poem
**** It's easier for experts
    Attention as resource - we have finite attention pools sharded by function -- we can only do two things at once if we're really good at one of them
    This is why you can generally type without paying attention, but you can't code without paying attention

    When (e.g.) a remote system is responding slowly this layer fails fast, and recovers slowly
    So that overall system timing doesn't grow to the timeout time.
    We use this technique in our services and in communicating with new services from dashboard (in conjunction with DL)

*** Sport Psychology
**** Doing two things at once isn't inherently bad, but you need to be very practised at one of them. e.g. athlete dribbling a ball
**** Attention as a resource
**** you can't do two things that require the same cognitive function at the same time, unless one is highly practiced. But its' been argued people have multiple pools related to function.
*** Why we make Mistakes
    p79 "Multitasking = forgetting"
    switching from task to task fills our working memory, we forget up to 40% of what we were doing.
*** "Can you multi task probably not well" - http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/08/27/can-you-multitask-probably-not-well/
    The self-selecting high multitaskers were consistently distracted significantly more by irrelevant images they were told to ignore. They also did worse in a task that tested whether they stored and organized information in their memories better than low multitaskers. Not surprisingly, the people who multitask often also did worse on the final task of testing for their ability to quickly switch between different kinds of information identification.
