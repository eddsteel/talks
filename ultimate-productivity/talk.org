  Key theme: I often run ls to remember what I'm doing
 #+END_NOTES
** =ls=
 #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - show ls operation, ls -l, ls -ldh ~
   - very useful
   - often find myself typing it when I return to a task and need to know where I am/what I'm doing
   - my goto 'what am i doing' tool
 #+END_NOTES
** =sl=
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - similar arguments to ls
   - Difference is... it shows a train
   - Can't ctrl-c it
   - Have to sit and watch and think about what you did
  #+END_NOTES
* Why did I just type =sl= instead of =ls=?
  -  You forgot that =l= isn't =s=
  -  You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
  -  You tried to do it too fast
  -  You're not paying attention
  -  You're trying to do too much at once

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Cognitive Science: how we think
    Attention is categorised -- different categories are suited to different purposes
    Attention is limited -- but it's not like a simple gauge that runs out
    behave like resource pools "sharded" by function.

    Selective attention is deeply focused, when all your resources are used for one thing
    [Divided] attention necessary for multi-tasking* and dealing with more than one thing at once
    We're actually really bad at multi-tasking, and in a study those who rated themselves good at it did worse

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Circumstances often force us to divide our attention, but with effort we can shift it back.
    We can learn techniques to make this easier
    We should know when we have selective attention on the task at hand.
    #+END_NOTES
** Attention as resource.
   - We have attention pools
   - They shard by brain function
   - It's easier for experts
   - No one can multitask
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
     Attention as resource - we have finite attention pools sharded by function
     e.g.
        hopping up and down doesn't affect your ability to remember the national anthem
        talking on the phone does affect your ability to write a poem
     we can only do two things at once if we're really good at one of them
     We are expert typers
     This is why you can generally type without paying attention, but you can't code without paying attention

** Electrical circuit breakers
    When current crosses a threshold, the circuit is broken and current goes to 0.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    When (e.g.) a remote system is responding slowly this layer fails fast, and recovers slowly
    So that overall system timing doesn't grow to the timeout time.
    We use this technique in our services and in communicating with new services from dashboard (in conjunction with DL)

* In general terms
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    A circuit breaker turns a sub-optimal situation into a broken one, demanding manual intervention

* sl is a circuit breaker for divided attention
* sl is a circuit breaker for divided attention
   it shows you when your attention is so depleted you can't even =ls= any more

** Impact of no breaker
        -  Study shows..
        - * In memory recognition task
        - * 80% success sequential completion
        - * 60% success with divided attention
        -  Anecdotally, we've all seen careless mistakes
** ....But I wouldn't recommend it for ops
        -  You forgot that l isn't s
        -  You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
        -  You tried to do it too fast
        -  Your mind is distracted
        -  You're trying to do too much at once
        -  *The server has died and you are the first responder*
** I'm sold!
        - =brew install sl=
        - =brew install gti= (if you =git status= to remember what you're doing)
* Questions?
