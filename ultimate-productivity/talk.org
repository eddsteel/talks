* Outline
** Demo - I often run ls to remember what I'm doing *
*** ls
**** very useful
**** often find myself typing it when I return to a task and need to know where I am/what I'm doing
**** goto 'what am i doing' tool
*** sl
**** similar arguments to ls
**** Can't ctrl-c it
**** Have to sit and watch and think about what you did
** Why did I just type `sl` instead of `ls` *
*** You forgot that l isn't s
*** You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
*** You tried to do it too fast
*** You're not paying attention
*** You're trying to do too much at once
** Attention - divided attention is no good for coding *
*** Cognitive Science is hard. The fundamentals are easy
    Cognitive science is a deep topic, but the basic principles of this are fairly simple.
*** Attention is a limited resource. We have attention pools.
    Attention as resource - we have finite attention pools sharded by function -- we can only do two things at once if we're really good at one of them
    This is why you can generally type without paying attention, but you can't code without paying attention
*** Attention can be categorised

    Circumstances often force us to divide our attention, but with effort we can shift it back.
    We can learn techniques to make this easier
    We should know when we have selective attention on the task at hand.

    [adapt http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/common/circuitbreaker.html]
    When (e.g.) a remote system is responding slowly this layer fails fast
    So that overall system timing doesn't grow to the timeout time.
    We use this technique in our services and in communicating with new services from dashboard (in conjunction with DL)
*** In general terms
    A circuit breaker turns a sub-optimal situation into a broken one, demanding manual intervention
*** sl is a circuit breaker for divided attention
** sl is a circuit breaker for divided attention - it shows you when your attention is so depleted you can't ls any more

**** Attention break-down
**** Attentional shift
**** (Attention as filter, attention as spotlight)
**** Attention as resource: a finite swap space that fills up and needs to be  <- this is promising
**** External/Internal causes
**** Techniques for improving
***** retaining attentional focus
***** shifting attentional focus
*** Sport Psychology
**** Doing two things at once isn't inherently bad, but you need to be very practised at one of them. e.g. athlete dribbling a ball
**** Attention as a resource
     you can't do two things that require the same cognitive function at the same time, unless one is highly practiced. But its' been argued people have multiple pools related to function.
*** Why we make Mistakes
    p79 "Multitasking = forgetting"
    switching from task to task fills our working memory, we forget up to 40% of what we were doing.
*** "Can you multi task probably not well" - http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/08/27/can-you-multitask-probably-not-well/
    The self-selecting high multitaskers were consistently distracted significantly more by irrelevant images they were told to ignore. They also did worse in a task that tested whether they stored and organized information in their memories better than low multitaskers. Not surprisingly, the people who multitask often also did worse on the final task of testing for their ability to quickly switch between different kinds of information identification.
