* Outline
** Demo
*** ls
**** very useful
**** often find myself typing it when I return to a task and need to know where I am/what I'm doing
**** goto 'what am i doing' tool
*** sl
**** similar arguments to ls
**** Can't ctrl-c it
**** Have to sit and watch and think about what you did
** Why did I just type `sl` instead of `ls`
*** You forgot that l isn't s
*** You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
*** You tried to do it too fast
*** Your mind is distracted
*** You're trying to do too much at once
** Circuit breakers
*** In electrical systems
**** diagram
**** components involved
**** effect
*** In computer systems
*** In general terms
** Attention, Focus, Concentration -- which are we talking about
** sl is circuit breaker for an [overwhelmed] person
*** those three things are symptoms of a mind that is [overwhelmed]
** How does a programmer get [overwhelmed]?
** Why don't we want [overwhelmed] people writing the code we maintain and support
** Why you don't want to spend most of your day [overwhelmed]

** But I wouldn't recommend it for ops
*** You forgot that l isn't s
*** You don't know where the keys are and you took a guess
*** You tried to do it too fast
*** Your mind is distracted
*** You're trying to do too much at once
*** The server has died and you are the first responder
** I'm sold!
*** brew install sl
*** brew install gti
